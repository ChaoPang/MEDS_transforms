"""Tests a multi-stage pre-processing pipeline. Only checks the end result, not the intermediate files.

Set the bash env variable `DO_USE_LOCAL_SCRIPTS=1` to use the local py files, rather than the installed
scripts.

In this test, the following stages are run:
  - filter_patients
  - add_time_derived_measurements
  - fit_outlier_detection
  - occlude_outliers
  - fit_normalization
  - fit_vocabulary_indices
  - normalization
  - tokenization
  - tensorization

The stage configuration arguments will be as given in the yaml block below:
