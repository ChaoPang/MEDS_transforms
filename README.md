# MEDS polars functions

A simple set of MEDS polars-based ETL and transformation functions. These functions include basic utilities
for putting data into MEDS format, pre-processing MEDS formatted data for deep learning modeling, tensorizing
MEDS data for efficient, at-scale deep learning training. Close analogs of these functions have been used to
successfully process data at the scale of billions of clinical events and millions of patients with modest
computational resource requirements in several hours of total runtime.

More details to come soon. In the meantime, see [this google
